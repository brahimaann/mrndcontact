We are building a landing page that collects user information and stores it in a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API. The frontend will be built with Next.js, React Hook Form, and Tailwind CSS. Form submissions will be handled by a Next.js API route that writes to Google Sheets via a Node.js backend using service account authentication.
